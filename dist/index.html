<p> Richmond presents a compelling case study to understand the housing crisis. </p>

<p> Located in the East San Francisco Bay Area, the city has been racially and economically diverse since its founding. Like many cities, Richmond has its own fault lines. There’s a history of housing inequity dating back to pre-WWII and a large corporate industry presence, both of which have contributed to early stages of gentrification and displacement of the city’s Black population. </p>

<p> Though Richmond has a unique history, the housing problems faced by there echo across many major American cities. Therefore, the story we set out to tell will be set in Richmond, but we hope learning about what has led to the housing crisis in a specific context can help with understanding this issue in its entirety. </p>

<p> This timeline project for INFO 247: Information Visualization and Presentation is only part of a larger MIMS capstone project. You can find the full project here, once it is completed. </p>

                        <p> Like many other cities in the Bay Area experiencing the housing crisis, Richmond suffers from issues of segregation and racial disparities among its residents. Residential segregation is the result of history, public policy, and racist ideologies. Segregation is problematic because it forces racial minorities and low-income residents to live in different geographies where they may have worse educational, economic, housing, and health outcomes compared to their White and/or wealthier counterparts. In Richmond, for example, one particular issue with the presence of the Chevron refinery is the disparities in the impact of environmental pollution. We'll discuss this later. </p>

                        <p> How does segregation become part of the law? In many cases, it is indirectly supported through the use of zoning laws. Zoning laws define land use into categories such as commercial, residential, or mixed (commercial and residential) use. Often highly prescriptive, they also specify which kinds of homes can be built and where - for example, single-family homes with a certain setback as opposed to dense, multi-family apartment complexes. </p>

                        <p> Past research shows that zones in the Bay Area tend to be correlated with race, as White families tend to live in single-family zones where they own their homes, while Black and brown families live in multi-family zones as renters. Interestingly, the current geographic distribution of Richmond's demographics is correlated with zones established in the 1950 Master Plan. </p>

                      </p>

                        <p> World War 2 was the start of Richmond's housing crisis. The dark boxes in the 1950 Master Plan represent temporary war housing projects, which were only able to house some of the city's shipyard workers, who were predominantly Black. They were torn down shortly after the war, but the legacy of this zoning plan remains. In 2021, those neighborhoods are still predominantly communities of color, especially for the Black and Hispanic residents in Richmond. </p>
